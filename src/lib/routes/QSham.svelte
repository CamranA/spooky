    <span slot="theTitle">Q Shaman Intro</span>
    <span slot="theBody"><p>I am here to reclaim the term "conspiracy theory". The term conspiracy theory has been
        weaponized against individuals searching for the truth, individuals like you and me. It has limited the range of
        subjects that we discuss, and has allowed powerful actors to escape accountability. They are dismissing
        legitimate concerns as conspiracy theories and cutting off the examination of corruption. Examing corruption is
        something I have spent decades doing dating back to studies on the Soviet Union, and it is something you are
        going to begin doing tonight.
        It is not an outlandish thing to say a conspiracy theory exists and they are fairly common. Follow along the
        clues I have laid out for you, and maybe... just maybe... you will uncover the truth.</p></span>

            Well, I sang a song. And that's a part of shamanism. It's about-- creating positive vibrations in a sacred chamber.
            I also stopped people from stealing and vandalizing that sacred space, the Senate. Okay?
            I actually stopped somebody from stealing muffins out of the-- out of the break room.
            And I also said a prayer in that sacred chamber.
            Because it was my intention to bring divinity, and to bring God back into the Senate.
            And that is-- and that is the one very serious regret that I have, was believing that when we were waved in by police officers, that it was acceptable.
            I consider myself a lover of my country.
            I consider myself a believer in the Constitution.
            I consider myself a believer in truth and our founding principles.
            I consider myself a believer in God.
